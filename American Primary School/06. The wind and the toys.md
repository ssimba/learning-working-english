## 06. The wind and the toys

Billy was coming down the street in his big red wagon. Little toy Dog and little toy Cat were in the wagon with him.

He saw his mother at the door. "Hello Mother!" he said. "I took my toys for a ride."

Mother said, "That is fine, Billy. But it is going to rain soon, and you must come in."

Soon the rain came down. Billy ran into the house, but he didn't put his toy away. 

Faster and faster came the rain. 

Soon the red wagon, the toy dog and the toy cat were very very wet.

Night was coming but no one put the toys away.

In the night, the wind came along. 

"Oo-oo,oo-oo, oo-oo" it said.

"Come with me, red wagon. Come along with me."

Away went the big red wagon down the street.

Away went the little toy dog and little toy cat.

On, on went down the hill.

"Oo-oo,oo-oo, oo-oo" Said the wind.

Next morning the sun was shining.

Billy looked in the front yard for his toys. But he did not see them. 

"Where is my wagon?" he said.

"Where is my little toy dog? Where is my little toy cat?"

Oh dear! Oh dear! I wish I had put them away.

Just then a little girl came along, she had the big red wagon. She had toy dog and toy cat too. "Hello Billy" said the little girl, "I found you little toys in the street. The wind took them down the hill, they are very very wet."

"Oh thank you, Betty." said Billy. "Next time, I will put them away."
