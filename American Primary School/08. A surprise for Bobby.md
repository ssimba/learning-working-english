## A surprise for Bobby

Every summer Bobby went to see his grandfather and grandmother. They lived on a farm. Bobby liked to go to the farm. He had a good time there.

He liked to help Grandfather feed the cows and pigs.

It was fun to be at the farm.

Bobby liked to help Grandmother feed the chickens. 

One day, Grandmother gave him a little yellow chicken. 'You may have this little chicken for you own,' she said. 'But you must feed it every day.'

'Oh thank you' he said. Every day Bobby went to feed the little yellow chicken. He gave it water too. 

Soon the summer was over, and father came to take Bobby home. He said goodbye to Grandmother and Grandfather. Then he ran to see his chicken. 

'Goodbye, little yellow chicken,' said Bobby. 'Do not forget me. I will come to see you again next summer.'

Next summer Bobby went back to the farm. He was glad to see his Grandefather and Grandmother. 

He ran to Grandmother and asked her about his yellow chicken. 

'Where is my chicken?' he asked.

Grandmother said 'we will see'. Soon they went to the **barn**. 

Bobby looked and looked, but he did not see his yellow little chicken.

Just then a big brown hen jumped from a nest. 

Here is your little yellow chicken, said Grandmother. 

Bobby saw an egg in the nest, 'Look look!' he said. 'I did not know my little chicken, but she did not forget me, she give me an egg for breakfast.'
