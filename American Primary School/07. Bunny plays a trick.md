## 07. Bunny plays a trick

Bunny Rabbit lived in a big hole under a tree.

He lived with his mother.

One day Bunny said: 'now I am a big rabbit, I must have my own home.'

Mother Rabbit said: 'Yes Bunny, you are a big rabbit now, you can make your own home. You can make it over there under that big tree.'

Bunny Rabbit began to dig.

Soon he had made a big hole for his new home. It had a front door and a back door. 

Bunny could go in the front door and come out the back door. 

He could go in the back door and come out the front door.

'Now I have my own home.' he said. 

One fine morning Bunny Rabbit sat in his own front door. He said: 'I must get some dinner. I am as hungry as I can be.'

So he went down the road to find something to eat. Hop hop hop he went.

All at once he saw a big dog. 'Oh dear' said Bunny, 'Here comes a big dog. I must run home.' Away ran Bunny Rabbit. Away run the big dog after him. 

Soon Bunny was at him front door. 'I will play a trick on that dog', he thought.

In he went, hop hop hop! The dog began to dig at the door, but Bunny ran out the back door, and the dog did not find him. 

'What a good trick!' said Bunny.
