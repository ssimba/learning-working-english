## 03. Fun in the Snow

The boys and girls were happy.

They were playing in the snow.

Some were making snow balls.

Some were making snow man on the hill.

Some were going down the hill on a big new sled.

'Come on, boys!', called Joe.

'Who wants a ride on my sled?'

Two boys jumped on the sled with Joe.

Away they went down the hill.

Soon Bubby found and old dish-pan in the snow.

'This will make a good sled' he said. Here I go.

Down, down the hill went Bobby in the old dish-pan.

He went this way and that way!

Round and round, faster and faster.

Then over went the dish-pan, and out went Bobby.

Over and over he went in the snow.

How the children laughed! Bobby laughed, too.

'That was a fine ride,' he said. 'The old dish-pan makes a good sled.'

'Let me ride' said Betty, 'Let me ride next' said Alice.

All the children wanted to ride in the old dish-pan.

Down the hill they went, this way and that way.

Some fell out in the snow and went over and over.

What a good time they had!

Soon there was a big round hole in the old dish-pan.

The children could not ride in it.

Bobby ran to the snow man and put the dish-pan on his head.

The children said: 'The dish-pan makes a fine hat for him.' 

Now his head will not be cold.

Then they all ran home.
