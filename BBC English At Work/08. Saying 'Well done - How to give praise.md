Well, Tom, Anna, yesterday was not a great day. Two clients came in with serious complaints. Mr Kumquart received a delivery of imitation bananas that were purple, not very convincing. 

And Mr Lime ordered grapefruits but got pineapples, Tom. 

Yeah, listen. Were you responsable for these errors? 

Well, yes but...

Look, mistake happen, But it seems that Mr Kumquart left our offices even angrier than when she came in and she saids she will never use Tip Top Trading again. 

I tried my best.
