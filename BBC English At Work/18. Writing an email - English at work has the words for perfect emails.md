 # 18 Writing an email - English at work has the words for perfect emails


Anna come and have a biscuit in my office.

No I didn't say yes.

You sent him an email and copied me in yesterday. That is not really a best way of writing an email to client, is it? Please could you re-send your message to Mr Lime, using actual words that make sense? 

Let me guess, Paul just spoke to you about email.

How do you know?

You copied me in remember? I just read it - or tried to.

But what is the problem, other people write like that.

No maybe some people write text message like that in an sms message on their phones, but that is completely the wrong style for an email to a client. 

> Ok Anna let's stop listening to Tom, he is a waste of space.There are the kinds of phrases you need in a business-related email:

1. Dear Mr Lime, I hope you are well
2. I am writing regarding...
3. Please could you confirm...
4. Yours sincerely or best wishes.

thank you I'll re-write my message.

The other problem with Stephanie is her legs are just too long. I'll ask to Tom.

Tom could you read this through before I send it? 

Dear Mr Lime I hope you are well, I am writing regarding your request for luxury boxes for the Imperial Lemon delivery. We will indeed be able to supply then
