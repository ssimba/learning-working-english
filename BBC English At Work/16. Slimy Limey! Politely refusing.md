# 16 Slimy Limey! Politely refusing 

Slimy: 虚伪的

Appropriate: 合适的相称的
With regret: 遗憾地，带着遗憾

1. Thank you for your offer, but I am really sorry, I won't be able to.
2. I am afraid it is against company policy.
3. It wouldn't be appropriate.
4. With regret, I'm going to have to say no.

Why do all the pens keep disappearing.

I am afraid it is against company policy to have non-business lunch with clients.

You are not allowed to if it is not for business. 

I think I have got that all down.

When can I invite you to lunch?
