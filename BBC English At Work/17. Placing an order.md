# 17 Placing an order 

Obsessed: 着迷的，无法摆脱的

Cruel:  残酷的残忍的

Anna, are you going to answer that?

Well Anna is behaving strangely.

I gave you a long lesson on how to answer the phone and you are still too scared.

It is not that, I recognize the number.

He must be absolutely desperate to get you to have lunch with him, even after your cruel rejection.

Anna is busy at the moment. Can I take a message? I'll pass that on to her.

He wants each Imperial Lemon you deliver to come in a luxury green box, like the you had at the presentation.

Let's make this order more politely okay?

Why are the English so obsessed with being so polite?

> I'd like to place an order for...
> We are going to need...
> Could you send...
> Could we also have...
> When can we expect to receive them?

Sorry about that, I'd like to place on order for some Imperial Lemon sized luxury boxes please, we are going to need quite a few.

Could you send 300 please? Could we also have the name of our company on the sides please. Ok.

You'd better phone back Mr Lime to confirm he can have these boxes, he is your client.

Copy in me Tom and Paul so it's clear you only mean business.
